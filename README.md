## üí° How to use

1. [Create a new repository](https://github.com/denorg/starter/generate) using this template
2. Update the project name ("Deno Starter") from the first line in `README.md`
3. Find and replace "denorg/starter" with your "username/repository" in `README.md`
4. Update the "Getting started" guide with your exported functions' names
5. In `.github/workflows/*.yml` files, add additional permissions after `deno test`
6. Setup Semantic Release
  - Add a repository secret `NPM_TOKEN` with your npm token
  - In `.github/workflows/deno.yml`, find and replace "denorg/starter" with your "username/repository"
7. Remove this section ("How to use") after setting up your respoitory

If you're not building a Denorg project, the following steps are required too:

1. Remove the "A project by Denorg..." footer from `README.md`
2. Remove the "Made by Denorg" shield from the `README.md` badges section
3. Change the "Denorg" name to yours in `LICENSE` and under "License" in `README.md`

## ‚≠ê Getting started

Import the `mode` function and use it:

```ts
import { mode } from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denorg/starter/master/mod.ts";

const result = mode();
```

### CLI with [DPX](https://github.com/denorg/dpx)

After [installing DPX](https://github.com/denorg/dpx), you can directly use the CLI using the `dpx` command:

```bash
dpx --allow-read starter <arguments>
```

### CLI

Alternatively, you can use it directly from the CLI by using `deno run`:

```bash
deno run --allow-read https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denorg/starter/master/cli.ts <arguments>
```

You can also install it globally using the following:

```bash
deno install --allow-read -n starter https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denorg/starter/master/cli.ts
```

Then, the package is available to run:

```bash
starter <arguments>
```

### Configuration

Required permissions:

1. `--allow-read`

## üë©‚Äçüíª Development

Run tests:

```bash
deno test --allow-read
```
